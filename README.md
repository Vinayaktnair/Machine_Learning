 **🏏 Pre-Cricket Match Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project is a machine learning–based web application that predicts the outcome of a cricket match **before it starts**, using historical match data and team-related features. The model is trained using the **Random Forest classifier** and deployed through a **Streamlit** web interface.



**Features**
- Predicts match outcome based on pre-match data
- Uses Random Forest for better accuracy and robustness
- Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit UI
- Trained on real cricket match datasets



**Machine Learning Model**
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Data preprocessing and feature selection applied
- Model serialized using `.pkl` files for deployment
